# BRIDGESAssignmentOne
Assignment One of BRIDGES (UNCC)

# Inspiration   
By completing this portion of the project(Assignment 1), I hope to have understood the appropriate BRIDGES API tools and frameworks to complete Maze Solver and Shortest Path on a Map. 

# Project Description 
The primary goal of the project was to produce an etched smiley using BRIDGES API tools found in class NonBlockingGame (listed on BRIDGES on GitHub page). An extension of the project was constructed with a second etched smiley that mimics the first one. 

# Algorithm 
Used nested for loops to print out background to the BRIDGES Visualization tool, and then overlay certain cells of different colors to produce the etch. A summary: 1. Create the base color 2. Etch the smiley at specific cells with different colors. 

# Challenges 
Using BRIDGES API tools and familiarizing with the necessary functions. It is important to understand the syntax of the BRIDGES functions, as well as the relationships between the multiple classes (how one class inherits from another or only aggregates from another class). 

# Accomplishments 
Using C++ combined with BRIDGES to produce a programming visualization. 

# Future Direction 
Complete further BRIDGES assignments, particularly Maze Solver and Shortest Path on Maps. 

# How to run File (Repl.it) 
1. Download etch.zip. 
2. Extract 
3. Upload files to Repl.it 
4. Follow instructions on Bridges Setup (https://bridgesuncc.github.io/bridges_setup_cxx_replit.html) 
   a. (Run in console) sh replit-cxx-setup.sh path-to-repl-project / (e.g. sh replit-cxx-setup.sh ${HOME}/CxxTest) 
   b. Change source file to etch.cpp / change exe to etch 
5. (Run in console) make (compile program) 
6. (Execute Program) ./etc
